<h1>Project: TDD Connect Four</h1>

Hopefully everyone has played Connect Four at some point (if not, see the Wikipedia page). It’s a basic game where each player takes turns dropping pieces into the cage. Players win if they manage to get 4 of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal.

The major difference here is that you’ll be doing this TDD-style. So figure out what needs to happen, write a (failing) test for it, then write the code to make that test pass, then see if there’s anything you can do to refactor your code and make it better.
